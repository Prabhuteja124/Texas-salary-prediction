# Texas Price Prediction :

##  Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to predict the **annual salaries** of Texas state employees based on various employee-related features.  
We used machine learning models to understand salary patterns and to build a strong predictive system.

##  The main objectives of this project:

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Build multiple machine learning models and **compare their performance**.
- **Tune hyperparameters** for better model generalization.
- Save the **best performing model** for future usage.
- Create **insightful visualizations** to summarize the findings.
